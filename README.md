# Mappy GG Translation
Translation of the Sega Game Gear game "Mappy" from Japanese to English. Since the game itself has English UI, this consists of replacing the single Kanji-using options screen with one in English.

This serves as an example of how you can:

* Replace screen drawing code with something entirely custom
* Patch ROMs using WLA DX to do the heavy lifting
* Make use of unused space in the ROM
* Use off-the-shelf compression to crunch the data down
